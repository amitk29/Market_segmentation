# Market_segmentation

Marketing is crucial for the growth and sustainability of any business. Marketers can help build the companyâ€™s brand, engage customers, grow revenue, and increase sales. One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their needs. By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs. If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation.
